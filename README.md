You can search for music and movies using the iTunes API. The search can be anything from movie name, director name, music artist name, song name, as long as there is some content tied to the search query then it will show in the results. 

What is also important is choosing the limit of the search correctly, if the search query doesn't have as many results as you typed in for limit, you will see the error handling message "The limit you have entered is too high for this search query, I will show you all I found for your search query!".

All you will have to do is run main.py in the terminal to get started.
